### PATCHED: This used to be done for free, but now that PRAW is paid software, this cannot be done for free.

## Why it was written
This program was written to download videos with youtube-dl on Reddit, compile it with moviePy, and upload these results onto YouTube. 
The resulting video will be a compilation, and it even has an intro an outro that gets added too.
