# Automated YouTube Channel

## IMPORTANT NOTES 
- PRAW has become a paid API, meaning this program is no longer free.
- The code worked back in January 2023, however, tests of it in May ran multiple errors.
- With the execution of this program now costing money, interest in this program has diminished.

## Why it was written
This program was written to download videos with youtube-dl on Reddit, compile it with moviePy, and upload these results onto YouTube. The resulting video will be a compilation, and it even has an intro and outro that gets added too.
